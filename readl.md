# Chapter11(Color)

**The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:**
* RGB values
* hex Codes
* Color names

**CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property sets the color of the background for that box.Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.**
